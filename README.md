# PowerBI-Dashboards
This is a sample PowerBI Dashboard that I created to highlight my Data Visualization skills. The dashboard is a revenue assurance dashboard showcasing risk analytics 
performed on sample data for a bank to show risks of revenue loss for the bankbased on their product's portfolios.
